# Development Tasks

## âœ… MAJOR MILESTONE: off_to_openmm.py COMPLETE!

### Phase 1 Complete: Force Field Converter âœ…
- [x] Set up GitHub repository (private)
- [x] Create project documentation files  
- [x] Set up testing infrastructure with pytest
- [x] Create test directory structure with sample .off files
- [x] Set up development tools (black, ruff)
- [x] Create script templates with command line interfaces
- [x] Analyze old script approaches and .off file structure
- [x] **COMPLETE off_to_openmm.py implementation:**
  - [x] Direct .off file parsing (OffFileParser class)
  - [x] Multi-molecule support with format variations ([MOLTYP]/[MOL], [ATOMS]/[ATOM])
  - [x] Special atom handling (4*, NETF, TORQ, M, MMM)
  - [x] Command line interface (-off, -output, -molnames, -charges)
  - [x] External charge file integration
  - [x] Complete XML force field generation:
    - [x] AtomTypes section with element extraction
    - [x] Residues section with unique atom naming and connectivity  
    - [x] NonbondedForce section with charges (correct parameters)
    - [x] HarmonicBondForce section with unit conversions
    - [x] HarmonicAngleForce section with degree-to-radian conversion
    - [x] PeriodicTorsionForce section with phase conversion
    - [x] CustomNonbondedForce for EXP interactions
    - [x] CustomNonbondedForce for SRD interactions (multiple powers)
    - [x] Proper ForceField XML wrapper structure

### Phase 2: Next Priority ðŸ”„
- [ ] **Implement pdb_preprocessor.py for CONECT record generation**
  - [ ] Read PDB files and parse ATOM records
  - [ ] Read force field XML to determine connectivity
  - [ ] Generate CONECT records based on bond definitions
  - [ ] Write updated PDB with connectivity information

### Future Enhancements ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and validation
- [ ] Expand integration tests with more molecular systems
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual parsing components
- [ ] Performance optimization for large .off files
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Support for additional .off file format variations

## Test Cases Available âœ…
- [x] 1-butanol.off + charges file - VERIFIED WORKING
- [x] hydrated_cyclohexene.off + charges file - VERIFIED WORKING
- [x] Multi-molecule systems (CYCQM + H2OQM) - VERIFIED WORKING
- [x] Integration testing with real molecular data - WORKING

## Technical Implementation Notes âœ…

âœ… Multiple format variations supported
âœ… External charges from .dat files with "AtomType Charge" format
âœ… Parameter extraction from #define statements at file end
âœ… Complete CustomNonbondedForce XML sections for EXP/SRD
âœ… Unit conversions (kcal/mol to kJ/mol, Angstrom to nm)
âœ… Unique atom naming system across all molecules
âœ… Special atom filtering and proper bond connectivity
