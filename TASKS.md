  - [x] Command line interface (-off, -output, -molnames, -charges)
  - [x] External charge file integration
  - [x] Complete XML force field generation:
    - [x] AtomTypes section with element extraction
    - [x] Residues section with unique atom naming and connectivity  
    - [x] NonbondedForce section with charges (correct parameters)
    - [x] HarmonicBondForce section with unit conversions
    - [x] HarmonicAngleForce section with degree-to-radian conversion

    - [x] CustomNonbondedForce for SRD interactions (multiple powers)
    - [x] Proper ForceField XML wrapper structure

### Phase 2: PDB Preprocessor Implementation ðŸš§
- [x] **Implement pdb_preprocessor.py for CONECT record generation**
  - [x] Read PDB files and parse ATOM records
  - [x] Read force field XML to determine connectivity  
  - [x] Atom class to atom type conversion functionality
  - [x] Generate CONECT records based on bond definitions
  - [x] Write updated PDB with connectivity information
  - [x] Residue name mapping system for compatibility

### Phase 3: PDB Compatibility Enhancement âœ… NEW!
- [x] **Add molname translation support to off_to_openmm.py**
  - [x] Add `-molname_translations` command line flag
  - [x] Implement custom 3-letter residue name mapping  
  - [x] Default behavior: use first 3 letters of molnames
  - [x] Update XML generation to use translated residue names
  - [x] Comprehensive testing with real data
  - [x] Backward compatibility maintained

### Recent Session Achievements âœ…
- [x] Discovered PDB/XML residue name compatibility issues
- [x] Implemented elegant solution via XML generator enhancement
- [x] Tested custom translations (CYCQMâ†’CYC, H2OQMâ†’SOL)  
- [x] Verified default 3-letter truncation behavior
- [x] Ensured PDB standard compliance throughout workflow

### Phase 4: Next Priorities ðŸ“‹
- [ ] **Complete PDB preprocessor integration testing**
  - [ ] Test with PDB-compatible XML files generated by off_to_openmm.py  
  - [ ] Verify CONECT record generation with real molecular systems
  - [ ] Test atom class/type conversion edge cases
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for malformed PDB files

### Future Enhancements ðŸ“‹
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and validation throughout
- [ ] Expand integration tests with more molecular systems  
- [ ] Add unit tests for individual parsing components
- [ ] Performance optimization for large .off files
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation and usage examples
- [ ] Support for additional .off file format variations
- [ ] Add support for other molecular file formats (MOL2, SDF)
- [ ] GUI wrapper for non-command-line users

## Test Cases Available âœ…
